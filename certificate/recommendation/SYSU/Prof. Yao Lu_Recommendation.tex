To Whom It May Concern: 

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Mr. Hai Jiang, 
a talented research assistant in my Computational Medical Imaging Laboratory (CMILAB) at Sun Yat-sen University, 
for admission to your esteemed program. 
As a Full Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering and 
a former Research Investigator at the University of Michigan's Department of Radiology, 
I have mentored numerous researchers and am confident in assessing candidates' potential for rigorous academic environments.

Hai Jiang has been an indispensable member of my team, demonstrating exceptional aptitude in medical imaging and deep learning. 
His work on improving diagnostic accuracy for Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) exemplifies his technical ingenuity. 
By designing a novel algorithm, he elevated the diagnostic AUC to over 80\%, a significant advancement for clinical decision-making. 
Additionally, he developed a CNNs-based diagnostic model for detecting sentinel axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, showcasing his versatility in applying AI to diverse medical challenges.

Beyond technical expertise, Hai exhibits remarkable intellectual curiosity and perseverance. 
His ability to independently troubleshoot complex problems and synthesize interdisciplinary knowledge—spanning radiology, computer vision, and clinical medicine—sets him apart. 
Notably, his paper on medical image analysis was accepted and presented at the prestigious IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025), a testament to his research rigor and communication skills.

Hai's creativity, work ethic, and dedication to advancing healthcare through technology align seamlessly with the goals of cutting-edge academic programs.
I am confident that Hai Jiang will not only thrive in your program but also emerge as a leader in his field. His blend of analytical rigor, technical proficiency, and passion for innovation makes him an outstanding candidate.
