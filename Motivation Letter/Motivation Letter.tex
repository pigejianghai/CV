I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD position in 
GeoAI and Large Language Models at your university. 
With a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics, 
extensive hands-on expertise in AI-driven medical image analysis, 
and a deep passion for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in geospatial science, 
I am eager to contribute to your research program.

% \textbf{Academic Background \& Research Expertise}\\
During my Master's studies (2019-2022), 
I specialized in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a focus on style transfer learning 
for personalized Chinese handwritten characters. 
This project sharpened my technical skills and reinforced my ability 
to apply innovative deep learning techniques—capabilities that I am enthusiastic 
to extend to cutting-edge LLM applications in your group's interdisciplinary research.

As a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University's Computational Medical Imaging Lab, 
I led two interdisciplinary projects that combined deep learning with clinical diagnostics. 
I developed a multi-task learning model 
to classify the severity of Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder using T2-weighted MRI images, 
achieving an AUC of 0.80. 
Additionally, I designed a CNN-based system 
to predict breast cancer metastasis in Sentinel Lymph Nodes via dual-energy CT scans, 
attaining an AUC of 0.85 in cross-validation. 
These experiences enriched my expertise in medical image analysis and deep learning, 
while also honing my skills in scholarly review, 
framework design, manuscript preparation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

% \textbf{Alignment}\\
I am particularly drawn to your program's emphasis on using LLMs 
to extract geographical information and navigation-related features from multimodal data, 
which aligns perfectly with my ambition to advance AI techniques in geospatial science. 
During my PhD, I plan to: 
(1) Stay current with the latest advancements in LLMs; 
(2) Develop robust methodologies for multimodal data analysis—including preprocessing, feature extraction, and data fusion; 
(3) Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to apply these models in navigation instruction generation; 
(4) Design and test an integrated visual and language navigation system; 
(4) Publish my findings in leading AI/ML conferences and journals.

% \textbf{Long-Term Goals}\\
A PhD at your university represents the ideal environment for me 
to advance my academic goals and contribute to innovative research in GeoAI. 
In the long term, I aspire to lead research in large language models and AI-driven geospatial science, 
and I am excited by the prospect of collaborating with a diverse team of researchers.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I am available to start \textbf{immediately} and 
am eager to contribute to your program at the \textbf{earliest} opportunity. 
I look forward to discussing how my background and research interests align with your department's strategic objectives.
