I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD position in 
Topological Deep Learning at your university. 
With a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics, 
extensive hands-on expertise in AI-driven medical image analysis, 
and a deep passion for topological/geometric frameworks in deep learning, 
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your research program.

% \textbf{Academic Background \& Research Expertise}\\
During my Master's studies (2019-2022), 
I specialized in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a focus on style transfer learning 
for personalized Chinese handwritten characters. 
This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also reinforced my ability 
to apply innovative computational methodsâ€”capabilities that will significantly benefit your group's research 
in state-of-the-art deep learning and its interdisciplinary applications.

As a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University's Computational Medical Imaging Lab, 
I led two interdisciplinary projects that combined deep learning with clinical diagnostics. 
I developed a multi-task learning model 
to classify the severity of Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder using T2-weighted MRI images, 
achieving an AUC of 0.80. 
Additionally, I designed a CNN-based system 
to predict breast cancer metastasis in Sentinel Lymph Nodes via dual-energy CT scans, 
attaining an AUC of 0.85 in cross-validation. 
These projects enriched my expertise in medical image analysis and deep learning, 
while also honing my skills in AI-driven research design, scholarly review, manuscript preparation, 
and interdisciplinary collaboration.

% \textbf{Alignment}\\
I am particularly drawn to your program's emphasis on topological frameworks, 
which perfectly aligns with my ambition to advance abstract theoretical analysis in deep learning. 
During my PhD, I plan to: 
(1) Stay current with the latest advancements in Topological Deep Learning; 
(2) Develop innovative topological deep learning frameworks; 
(3) Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to apply these frameworks to practical problems; 
(4) Publish my findings in leading AI/ML conferences and journals.

% \textbf{Long-Term Goals}\\
A PhD at your university provides the ideal environment to advance my academic goals 
and enhance the precision of models for predicting complex systems. 
In the long term, I aspire to lead research in topological and explainable AI models, 
and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working with a diverse team of researchers.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and research interests align with your department's strategic objectives.
