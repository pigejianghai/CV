I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the PhD position in 
Human-AI Interaction and Operations Management at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
With a robust foundation in AI/ML research, 
hands-on experience in translating theoretical frameworks into real-world solutions, 
and a strong alignment with TUM's interdisciplinary ethos, 
I am eager to contribute to your research group's pioneering work at the intersection of 
human decision-making and artificial intelligence.

% \textbf{Academic Background \& Research Expertise}\\
During my Master's in Computational Mathematics (2019-2022), 
I specialized in \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}, 
focusing on style transfer applications. 
My thesis, \emph{``GANs for Personal Style Imitation of Chinese Handwritten Characters,''} 
involved developing an end-to-end CycleGAN framework to replicate the calligraphic style of Shiling Shen Chern. 
By optimizing adversarial training and incorporating domain-specific preprocessing, 
I achieved 85\% visual similarity across 220 characters—a 10\% improvement over baseline models. 
This work honed my expertise in GAN architecture design, data augmentation, and cross-domain adaptation, 
while reinforcing my passion for bridging technical innovation with human-centric applications.

Post-graduation, I joined Sun Yat-sen University's \textbf{Computational Medical Imaging Lab}, 
where I led AI-driven projects with clinical impact. 
For instance, I designed a \textbf{multi-task learning model} to 
classify Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder severity using T2-WI MRI images, achieving an \textbf{AUC of 0.80}. 
In another project, I developed a CNN-based system to predict breast cancer metastasis 
in Sentinel Lymph Nodes via dual-energy CT scans, attaining an \textbf{AUC of 0.85} in cross-validation. 
Beyond algorithmic development, I spearheaded end-to-end workflows—from curating heterogeneous DICOM datasets to 
deploying models on hospital servers—culminating in two first-authored papers (one published, one under revision). 
These experiences underscored my ability to navigate interdisciplinary challenges and deliver scalable AI solutions.

% \textbf{Alignment}\\
Your program's emphasis on \textbf{Human-AI Interaction} 
uniquely aligns with my aspiration to explore how AI can augment human decision-making in complex operational environments.  
I am particularly drawn to Dr. Kejia Hu's research on human-algorithm collaboration in business contexts, 
which resonates with my goal to design \textbf{cooperative AI frameworks} that balance technical rigor with human intuition. 
For example, my work in medical imaging required close collaboration with clinicians to 
ensure models addressed practical diagnostic needs—a precursor to 
the human-in-the-loop systems I aim to develop during my PhD.

Moreover, TUM's partnerships with industry leaders and access to cutting-edge facilities, 
such as the TUM School of Logistics and Supply Chain Management group, 
provide an ideal environment to investigate operational challenges like 
resource allocation and strategic planning in AI-driven settings. 
I am keen to contribute to projects exploring human biases in 
AI-assisted logistics or adaptive learning systems for dynamic supply chains.

% \textbf{Long-Term Goals}\\
Long-term, I aspire to pioneer \textbf{Human-AI Interaction} that 
harmonize computational precision with ethical and societal considerations. 
This PhD would equip me with the interdisciplinary toolkit—spanning behavioral science, operations research, 
and machine learning—to establish a research lab focused on human-AI symbiosis. 
TUM's emphasis on translational research and its vibrant academic network will be instrumental in realizing this vision.

I am confident that my technical expertise, passion for interdisciplinary collaboration, 
and alignment with TUM's strategic priorities position me to thrive in your program. 
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could support your ongoing initiatives, 
such as optimizing human-AI teamwork in high-stakes operational scenarios. 
Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to contributing to TUM's legacy of innovation and impact.
