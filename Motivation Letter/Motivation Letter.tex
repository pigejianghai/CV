I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the PhD position in 
\textbf{Machine Learning and Game Theory at the Technical University of Munich (TUM)}. 
My academic trajectory, research experience in AI/ML, 
and alignment with TUM's interdisciplinary vision make me a strong candidate 
to contribute meaningfully to your research group.

% \textbf{Academic Background \& Research Expertise}\\
During my Master's in Computational Mathematics (2019), 
I specialized in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), 
implementing Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) 
to replicate the handwritten Chinese characters of Shiling Shen Chern. 
By innovating an end-to-end style-transfer learning trajectory, 
I achieved a 85\% visual similarity score across 220 characters—a significant improvement over baseline models. 
This work culminating in my Master's thesis, 
\emph{``GANs based Personal Style Imitation of Chinese Handwritten Characters.''} 
This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in GANs, 
data preprocessing, manuscript analysis, and code replication. 

Post-graduation, I joined Sun Yat-sen University's Computational Medical Imaging Diagnosis Lab, 
leading AI-driven medical imaging projects. 
For instance, the first project focuses on diagnosing Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders, 
aiming to classify the severity of the disease using T2-WI MRI images. 
By implementing a multi-task learning method, 
our proposed model achieving an averaged AUC score of 0.80. 
Moreover, 
I developed a CNN-based model to predict metastasis in Sentinel Lymph Nodes (breast cancer) using dual-energy CT images, 
achieving an averaged AUC score of 0.85 among three-fold cross-validation. 
My role involved end-to-end pipeline design, 
from preprocessing heterogeneous DICOM data to deploying models on hospital servers. 
These projects underscored my ability to translate theoretical ML frameworks into real-world applications, 
resulting in two first-authored papers (one of them currently under revision).

% \textbf{Alignment}\\
Your program's focus on \textbf{Game Theory and Multi-Agent Systems} 
deeply resonates with my goal to explore strategic decision-making in AI. 
I am particularly inspired by Prof. [Name]'s work on [specific paper/topic], 
which aligns with my interest in developing cooperative GAN frameworks where agents optimize Nash equilibria. 
During my PhD, I aim to investigate 
how game-theoretic principles can enhance robustness in generative models—a direction 
that bridges my expertise in adversarial networks with TUM's strengths in algorithmic foundations.

% \textbf{Long-Term Goals}\\
I aspire to pioneer ethical AI systems that harmonize mathematical rigor with societal impact, 
ultimately establishing a research lab focused on trustworthy ML. 
TUM's emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, access to the [specific lab/facility], 
and partnerships with institutions like the Munich School of Robotics provide an ideal ecosystem to advance these ambitions.

% \textbf{Why I Am a Strong Fit}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Technical Depth}: Proficiency in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and optimization frameworks, validated by peer-reviewed publications.
	\item \textbf{Interdisciplinary Agility:} Experience spanning theoretical ML, medical AI, and ethical implications.
	\item \textbf{Vision}: A clear research agenda that synergizes with TUM's focus on foundational AI and real-world applications.
\end{itemize}

I am eager to contribute to ongoing projects in your group, 
such as [specific project or initiative mentioned on TUM's website], 
and would welcome the chance to discuss how my background aligns with your priorities. 
Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the possibility of joining TUM's vibrant academic community.
