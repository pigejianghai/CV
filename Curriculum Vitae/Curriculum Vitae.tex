% ■	A task of the project National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC) under Grant 12126610, is in progress. 
% The project aimed to develop a personalized prediction model for early breast cancer prevention in the Chinese female population. \\
% ■	The task aims to detect the breast architectural distortion based on the DBT(Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) volume with two different angles. 
% Inspired by the Siamese-Networks initially used in face recognition, the task utilized the Siamese architecture to extract and compare information from both views. 
% Experimental results show that the corresponding triplet module did help the False-Positive reduction from two angles.\\
% ■	My involvement in the project focused on preparatory works including providing ideas and consultation.\\
% ■	I gained my knowledge in multiple machine learning methods, 
% including automatic assessment of architectural distortion, detection technology in deep learning, et al.\\
