% I am writing to express my keen interest in the PhD position at your university. 
% % specializing in \textbf{Machine Learning on large databases for interventional cardiac PCI treatment}. 
% My academic background and research experience have equipped me with the skills and knowledge 
% necessary for advanced study in this position.

% % \spacesubsection
% My journey began with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
% leading me to pursue a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics in 2019, 
% following a Bachelor's degree in Information Security in China. 
% For my Master's project, I focused on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) of Deep Learning (DL), 
% specifically for handwriting style imitation. 
% In this project, I developed a GANs-based model to replicate individual handwriting styles, 
% focusing on emulating the handwritten Chinese characters of Shiing Shen Chern from a dataset of around 220 characters. 
% This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in GANs, 
% data preprocessing, manuscript analysis, and code replication, 
% culminating in my Master's thesis, \emph{``GANs based Personal Style Imitation of Chinese Handwritten Characters.''}

% % \spacesubsection
% % Following my Master's degree, 
% % I contributed to the Compressed Sensing MRI ADMM-Net project, 
% % which combined DL with numerical approximation theory. 
% % Traditional algorithms often lose image detail with repeated iterations, 
% % but by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
% % our team demonstrated how DL can dynamically adjust parameters to preserve fine details. 
% % This project deepened my understanding of convergent algorithm theory, proof construction, 
% % and the balance between theoretical approaches and practical applications, 
% % while refining my programming and analytical skills.

% % \spacesubsection
% After completing my degree, 
% I joined a research group at Sun Yat-sen University focused on Computer-aided diagnosis, 
% where I worked as a Research Assistant on several impactful projects. 
% These included diagnosing Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders, 
% predicting metastasis in Sentinel Axillary Lymph Nodes in breast cancer, 
% and assessing responses to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy via MRI. 
% Through these projects, I gained further expertise in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, 
% along with experience in manuscript research and scientific writing.

% % \spacesubsection
% My long-term goal is to build a career in academia, 
% contributing to the meaningful implementation of innovative solutions through 
% the integration of Computer Science and Mathematics. 
% The cutting-edge and interdisciplinary nature of this PhD program, 
% combined with the expertise and accomplishments of the research team, 
% aligns seamlessly with my academic and professional aspirations, as well as my personal interests. 
% This position represents an excellent opportunity to advance toward my goals, 
% and I am eager to join an environment that fosters intellectual rigor, collaboration, 
% and access to the resources needed to achieve my ambitions.

% % \spacesubsection
% I am confident that I am a strong candidate for this position within your research group. 
% The focus on Machine Learning and Game Theory closely aligns with my interests and expertise. 
% I am particularly passionate about developing AI/ML algorithms and advancing fundamental theories 
% to support research in this area. 
% % Moreover, I am highly interested in algorithms that enable more objective disease monitoring 
% % through digital voice and gait recordings, as well as neuroimaging. 
% My interdisciplinary background, programming skills, and research experience uniquely position me 
% to excel in and make meaningful contributions to the challenges and demands of this PhD opportunity.

% % \spacesubsection
% I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your research community 
% and contribute actively while continuing to develop my expertise. 
% Thank you for considering my application, 
% and I look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and goals align with your program.

% ■	A task of the project National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC) under Grant 12126610, is in progress. 
% The project aimed to develop a personalized prediction model for early breast cancer prevention in the Chinese female population. \\
% ■	The task aims to detect the breast architectural distortion based on the DBT(Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) volume with two different angles. 
% Inspired by the Siamese-Networks initially used in face recognition, the task utilized the Siamese architecture to extract and compare information from both views. 
% Experimental results show that the corresponding triplet module did help the False-Positive reduction from two angles.\\
% ■	My involvement in the project focused on preparatory works including providing ideas and consultation.\\
% ■	I gained my knowledge in multiple machine learning methods, 
% including automatic assessment of architectural distortion, detection technology in deep learning, et al.\\
