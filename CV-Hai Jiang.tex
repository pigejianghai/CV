\makelettertitle
I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position at your university, 
specializing in \textbf{Artificial Intelligence Methodology (AIM)}. 
My academic background and research experience have prepared me well for advanced study in this field, 
and I am highly motivated to contributed to cutting-edge research that combines AI with Mathematics. 
\ \\
\ \\
My journey began with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
leading me to pursue a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics in 2019, 
following a Bachelor's degree in Information Security in China. 
For my Master's project, I focused on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) of Deep Learning (DL), 
specifically for handwriting style imitation. 
In this project, I developed a GAN-based model to replicate individual handwriting styles, 
focusing on emulating the handwritten Chinese characters of Shiing Shen Chern from a dataset of around 220 characters. 
This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in GANs, 
data preprocessing, manuscript analysis, and code replication, 
culminating in my Master's thesis, \emph{“GANs based Personal Style Imitation of Chinese Handwritten Characters.”}
\ \\
\ \\
Following my Master's degree, 
I contributed to the Compressed Sensing MRI ADMM-Net project, 
which combined DL with numerical approximation theory. 
Traditional algorithms often lose image detail with repeated iterations, 
but by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
our team demonstrated how DL can dynamically adjust parameters to preserve fine details. 
This project deepened my understanding of convergent algorithm theory, proof construction, 
and the balance between theoretical approaches and practical applications, 
while refining my programming and analytical skills.
\ \\
\ \\
After completing my degree, 
I joined a research group at Sun Yat-sen University focused on Computer-aided diagnosis, 
where I worked as a Research Assistant on several impactful projects. 
These included diagnosing Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders, 
predicting metastasis in Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in breast cancer, 
and assessing responses to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy via MRI. 
Through these projects, I gained further expertise in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, 
along with experience in manuscript research and scientific writing.
\ \\
\ \\
I believe I am a strong candidate for this position within your research group. 
Your focus areas, such as medical image analysis, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), 
and computer-assisted interventions (CAI), align closely with my research interests, 
particularly in advancing multi-modal data analysis and enhancing the molecular characterization of glioma subtypes. 
My interdisciplinary background, programming expertise, 
and research experience equip me well for the challenges and rigor of this PhD position.
\ \\
\ \\
My long-term goal is to establish a career in academia, 
where I can contribute to the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics through meaningful research and innovation. 
The interdisciplinary nature of your group, alongside the expertise and contributions of its members, 
closely matches my academic and professional aspirations, making this position an ideal next step. 
I am eager to join an environment that fosters intellectual rigor and collaboration, 
providing the resources essential to realizing my goals.
\ \\
\ \\
I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your research community 
and contribute actively while continuing to develop my expertise. 
Thank you for considering my application, 
and I look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and goals align with your program.

% Inspired by the Siamese-Networks initially used in face recognition, the task utilized the Siamese architecture to extract and compare information from both views. 
% Experimental results show that the corresponding triplet module did help the False-Positive reduction from two angles.\\
% ■	My involvement in the project focused on preparatory works including providing ideas and consultation.\\
