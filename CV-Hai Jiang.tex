\makelettertitle
I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position at your university, 
specializing in Computer Vision within Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
With a solid foundation in Deep Learning and a genuine passion for advancing AI research, 
I am confident that my academic background and research experience uniquely position me 
to contribute to and thrive within your esteemed research group. 
\ \\
\ \\
Driven by a deep-seated interest in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
I pursued my studies in Computational Mathematics in 2019 
after completing a Bachelor's degree in Information Security in China. 
During my Master's program, I focused on Deep Learning, 
particularly within the context of style imitation in handwriting. 
I contributed to a project aimed at replicating individual handwriting styles, 
specifically emulating the Chinese handwritten characters of Shiing Shen Chern from a set of approximately 220 characters. 
This project provided me with hands-on experience in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), 
manuscript research, data preprocessing, and code replication, 
culminating in my Master's thesis titled, \emph{“GANs based Personal style imitation of Chinese handwritten characters.”}
\ \\
\ \\
Following this, I had the opportunity to work on the Compressed Sensing MRI ADMM-Net project, 
which integrated Deep Learning with numerical approximation theory. 
Traditional algorithms often struggle with complex images, losing intricate details after multiple iterations. 
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
our team explored how Deep Learning could dynamically adjust parameters during iterations to preserve these details. 
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into convergent algorithm theory, 
proof construction, and the synergy between theory and practical application. 
This experience deepened my understanding of algorithmic approaches and refined my programming skills. 
\ \\
\ \\
After earning my Master's degree in Computational Mathematics, 
I joined a research group at Sun Yat-sen University focused on Computer-Assisted Diagnosis, 
where I served as a Research Assistant. 
My responsibilities included contributing to a successful proposal for 
a key Science and Technology program in China (2023YFE0204300), 
preparing progress and completion reports for projects funded by 
the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 81971691 and 12126610), 
and drafting technical specifications for a patent and a medical device application. 
In particular, I participated in three significant research projects addressing medical challenges 
such as diagnosing Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders, 
predicting metastasis in Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes, and assessing responses to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy via MRI. 
Although the first two projects achieved strong experimental results, 
they highlighted areas where further technological innovation could be explored. 
Through these experiences, I honed my skills in programming languages 
such as Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, as well as in manuscript research.
\ \\
\ \\
My long-term goal is to pursue a career in academia, 
where I can contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge in Computer Science and AI. 
Your research group's work aligns closely with my own academic and professional ambitions, 
making this PhD position an ideal step toward my aspirations. 
I am eager to join an environment that provides both the intellectual rigor and resources essential to achieving my goals.
\ \\
\ \\
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining your research community, 
where I hope to contribute actively while further developing my expertise. 
Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and goals align with your program.

% ■	The task aims to detect the breast architectural distortion based on the DBT(Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) volume with two different angles. 
% Inspired by the Siamese-Networks initially used in face recognition, the task utilized the Siamese architecture to extract and compare information from both views. 
% Experimental results show that the corresponding triplet module did help the False-Positive reduction from two angles.\\
% ■	My involvement in the project focused on preparatory works including providing ideas and consultation.\\
% ■	I gained my knowledge in multiple machine learning methods, 
% including automatic assessment of architectural distortion, detection technology in deep learning, et al.\\
