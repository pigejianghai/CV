Dear Madam, dear Sir, 

It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend Mr. Hai Jiang for admission to your esteemed program. 
As his academic advisor during his undergraduate studies at Nankai University's School of Mathematical Sciences, 
I have closely observed his intellectual growth and am confident in his potential to excel in advanced academic pursuits.

Hai Jiang distinguished himself as an exceptional student in Computational Mathematics, 
consistently demonstrating analytical rigor, creativity, and dedication. 
His senior thesis, \emph{``GANs-Based Personal Style Imitation of Chinese Handwritten Characters,'' }
exemplifies his technical prowess and innovative thinking. 
In this project, 
he successfully adapted CycleGANs to replicate personalized Chinese handwriting styles and introduced Deformable Convolutional Networks to refine character generation quality. 
These contributions not only highlight his mastery of deep learning and mathematical modeling but also his ability to tackle complex, interdisciplinary challenges.

Beyond academic achievements, Hai possesses remarkable personal qualities. 
He is highly self-motivated, often seeking additional resources to deepen his understanding of mathematical theories and AI applications. 
During collaborative projects, he proved to be a reliable team member, 
balancing independent work with constructive group contributions. 
His open-mindedness and communication skills enabled him to engage effectively with peers and faculty, 
fostering a productive academic environment.

What truly sets Hai apart is his intellectual curiosity and resilience. 
When confronted with obstacles in his research, he approached them methodically, 
iterating solutions until achieving optimal results. 
His proactive attitude and problem-solving mindset make him well-suited for rigorous academic challenges.

I am confident that Hai Jiang will thrive in your program and contribute meaningfully to your academic community. 
His passion for learning, coupled with his technical expertise and strong work ethic, 
positions him as an outstanding candidate. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details.

% I remain at your disposal in case you would have any requests for further information.
